                Hello, my name is Jared Lewis, currently a junior at Arsenal Technical High School. Ever since
                 I was younger, I've had a fascination with building things, whether it was constructing model
                  cities with Lego bricks or assembling DIY projects with my dad in the garage. This hands-on 
                  experience sparked my interest in engineering and technology from an early age. Recently, 
                  I've developed a keen interest in coding, finding joy in the logic and creativity of 
                  programming languages. My diverse aspirations range from robotics and coding to soccer and 
                  representing my country in the World Cup. After much reflection, I've focused my ambitions 
                  on developing, building, and programming robots with the ultimate goal of making my mom proud 
                  through my achievements. I envision creating robots that profoundly impact people's lives, 
                  whether by designing fully autonomous public transportation buses to enhance daily commutes
                  or developing robotic prosthetics to restore mobility for those in need. Beyond academics, 
                  I actively participate in robotics clubs, soccer teams, and have engaged in various camps 
                  and internships to broaden my skills. Looking forward, I plan to pursue mechanical engineering 
                  at Purdue University, undecided yet considering a double major or minor in computer science. 
                  In my spare time, I find joy in staying active with workouts and playing soccer.
